create_issue "[EPIC] Implement Proof-of-Device-Distribution (PoDD) System" \
"## The Core Innovation: Proving Multiple Small Miners vs One Large Miner

### Objective
Create a cryptographic system that can distinguish between:
- 10 Bitaxes mining separately 
- 1 Antminer pretending to be 10 devices

### Key Components
1. Hardware fingerprinting via timing analysis
2. Nonce pattern statistical analysis  
3. Network behavior verification
4. Challenge-response protocols
5. Community verification layer

### Success Criteria
- 95% accuracy in detecting split mining
- < 1% false positive rate for legitimate small miners
- Gaming cost exceeds reward benefit
- Real-world tested with actual Bitaxe devices

### Sub-tasks
- Research timing analysis methods
- Develop pattern recognition algorithms
- Create hardware testing framework
- Build verification protocol
- Implement anti-gaming measures

This is the most critical and innovative feature of SYNC!" \
